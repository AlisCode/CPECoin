**NOTE**: This is a school project, essentially for fun and learning purposes, please **don't** ever try to use this as a real crypto-currency system (you won't be able to, anyway :))

## Motivation

* Understanding & learning how to build a Blockchain
* Showing what Rust is capable of
* Having a good grade on the English presentation I made about this 

## How to use ?

First things first: **you don't**. This is an educational project and isn't ready for any kind of real-world use. However, if you're into self-inflicted pain, then here we go :)

### Cloning the project and building it

Clone the repo, then cd into it and cargo-build it.

git clone https://github.com/AlisCode/CPECoin
cd CPECoin
cargo build --release

If everything goes well, you should have **4 binaries** generated in the /target/release folder.
You're ready to use the CPECoin blockchain! Yay !

Before we go any further, it is worth noting that every single one of the generated binaries is a command-line executable, adhering to the Unix philosophy of "Doing one thing, and doing it well."
If you ever doubt about how to use an executable, then run the program with -h option to get help.

### Generating a wallet 

Generating your wallet is the first part to collect your CPECoins. Just run ./wallet, and a file wallet.cpecoin containing your secret and private key will be automatically generated
